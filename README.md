# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository serves as a backup for my code implementations of various data structures, algorithms, and contest solutions.

## Contents

This repository contains code files organized into different folders based on the topic or programming language. Here's an overview of the main folders:

- `data-structures`: Implementations of common data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
- `algorithms`: Implementations of popular algorithms like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.
- `contest-code`: Solutions to programming contests, coding challenges, and algorithmic problem-solving competitions.

Feel free to explore the folders and files to learn about different data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

## Usage

You are welcome to use this repository as a learning resource or reference for your own projects. Feel free to browse the code, understand the implementations, and adapt them to suit your needs.

## Contributing

I'm open to contributions that improve the code quality, add new data structures or algorithms, or provide better solutions for existing problems. If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, or enhancements, please submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing coding style and include appropriate tests.
